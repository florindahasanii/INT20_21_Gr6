    <h3>faqs</h3>
<p><b>Do you offer delivery?</b> We are currently unable to offer delivery with our own internal drivers. We are happy to suggest a courier service that can come and pick up the order and deliver it to you. Of course if you tell us when you need it we will have it ready for you to pick up at your convenience.</p>

<p><b>How much notice do you need? </b> The more notice the better! Within reason we can accommodate many orders with 24-48 hours notice. Please be aware that some specialty items do require 3 days advanced notice as well as a minimum order.

</p>
<p><b>Do you offer tables, chairs, linens, staffing and clean-up?</b>Since we are not a full-service catering company we typically do not provide tables, chair, linens, staffing, or clean-up for your event. We are happy to assist with minor set-up of your order upon delivery.</p>
<p><b>Do you offer plates, napkins, and utensils?</b> Yes! We are happy to provide disposable plates, napkins, and utensils for your event.</p>
<p><b>What if I need to cancel my order?</b> We ask for at least 24 hours notice for all order cancellations.</p>
<p><b>What if my group is tax exempt?</b>We will need the forms ST2 and ST5 to provide tax exemption for your group before your order is delivered or picked up. Please ensure that both parts 1 and 2 of the ST5 are completed. If placing an order via email please include these forms. If you are ordering over the phone our staff can let you know the best way to provide this information. As of September 1st, 2019 we are unable to refund tax after an order has been completed and the card has been charged. If you need tax refunded after payment has been processed, you will need to contact the Department of Revenue directly. </p>
<p><b>What type of payment do you accept?</b>For all catering orders we require a credit card (all major cards accepted). This card is used to hold your order and charged the day of your event. We provide a receipt with delivery and can email a copy upon request.</p>
